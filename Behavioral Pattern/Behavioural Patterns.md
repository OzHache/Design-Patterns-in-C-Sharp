# Behavioural Patterns 
The Behavioral Patterns are designed to identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

The Behavioral Patterns include:
- Chain of Responsibility - Command - Interpreter - Iterator - Mediator - Mememto - Observer - State - Strategy - Template Method - Visitor
- Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
- Interpreter is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a grammar for a language and then define a corresponding interpreter that uses the grammar to interpret sentences in the language.
- Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
- Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.
- Mememto is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
- Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
- State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.
- Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
