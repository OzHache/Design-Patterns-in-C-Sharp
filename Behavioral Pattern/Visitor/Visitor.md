# The Visitor Pattern
The Visitor Pattern allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. The Visitor Pattern is useful when you have a class that has a method that performs a series of steps. You can use the Visitor Pattern to define the steps of the method in a base class, and then have subclasses implement the steps. This is useful because you can have a single base class that can handle all of the different steps of the method. This is better than having a separate class for each step, because it is easier to maintain and extend. You can also easily add new steps to the method without having to change the existing code.

An Example of this in Game Development might be: An AI Updater that updates the AI of all of the characters in the game. You can use the Visitor Pattern to define the steps of the AI Updater in a base class, and then have subclasses implement the steps. 

The members of the Visitor Pattern are:
- Visitor: The class that defines the steps of the method.
- ConcreteVisitor: The class that implements the steps of the method.
- Element: The class that contains the method.
- ConcreteElement: The class that contains the method.
- Client: The class that uses the Element.
- ObjectStructure: The class that contains the Elements.
