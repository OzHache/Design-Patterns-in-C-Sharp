# The Composite Pattern
The Composite Pattern is also known as the Part/Whole Pattern
The Members of the Composite Pattern are:
- The Component which is the interface that the client expects to see
- The Leaf which is the class that implements the Component interface
- The Composite which is the class that implements the Component interface
- The Client which is the class that uses the Component interface
  
The Composite pattern is differentiated from the Decorator pattern in that the Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an object, while the Composite pattern is used to compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
