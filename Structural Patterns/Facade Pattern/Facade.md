# The Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern is also known as the Facade Object Pattern
The Members of the Facade Pattern are:
- The Facade which is the class that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- The Subsystem which is the class that implements the complex functionality
- The Client which is the class that uses the Facade

The Facade pattern is also differentiated from the Decorator pattern in that the Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an object, while the Facade pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
