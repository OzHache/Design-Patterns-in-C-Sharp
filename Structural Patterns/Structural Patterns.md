Structural Patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
The Structural patterns include:
- Adapter - Bridge - Composite - Decorator - Facade - Flyweight - Proxy
- Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
- Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.


Composite Vs Decorator Vs Proxy
 The Composite pattern is used to compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects. The Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an object. The Proxy pattern is used to provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 

 Adapter Vs Bridge
    The Adapter pattern is used to adapt an interface to another interface. The Bridge pattern is used to adapt an implementation to an interface.
