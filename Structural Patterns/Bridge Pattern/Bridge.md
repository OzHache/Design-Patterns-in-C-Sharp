# The Bridge Pattern
The Bridge Pattern is also known as the Handle/Body Pattern
The Members of the Bridge Pattern are:
- The Abstraction which is the interface that the client expects to see
- The Refined Abstraction which is the class that adapts the Implementor to the Abstraction
- The Implementor which is the class that is being adapted to the Abstraction
- The Concrete Implementor which is the class that is being adapted to the Implementor

The Bridge pattern is differentiated from the Adapter pattern in that the Adapter pattern is used to adapt an interface to another interface, while the Bridge pattern is used to adapt an implementation to an interface. The Bridge pattern is also differentiated from the Decorator pattern in that the Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an object, while the Bridge pattern is used to separate the interface from the implementation.
