# The Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
The Members of the Singleton Pattern are:
- Singleton: defines an Instance operation that lets clients access its unique instance. Instance is a class operation.
- Singleton class: the class of the single instance. The responsibility of this class is to store its own unique instance.
- Client: uses the Singleton instance.
