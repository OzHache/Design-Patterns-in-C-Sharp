# Creational Patterns
Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
The Creational Patterns include:
- Abstract Factory - Builder - Factory Method - Prototype - Singleton
- Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
